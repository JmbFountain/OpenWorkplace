# OpenWorkplace
Digital Workplace using open-source tools

The Aim of this project is to create a solution for a Digital Workplace environments, where the use of proprietary Software and SaaS is not possible.
To achieve this, we are not going to reinvent the wheel as a whole, but rather rely on already existing, popular and well-maintained FOSS-Projects.

As my primary platform is Debian, this will be the Platform this Project gets started on, but pull requests adding compatibility for other Distributions are welcome. If this gains enough traction, I will also work on the CentOS code.

My test environment is a Debian Buster Host with LXC-Containering.
